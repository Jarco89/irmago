This folder contains the migration code for migrating from the old keyshare server to the new go keyshare server. The intent is to remove this code once the new keyshare server is running in production and deemed stable.

This code converts most of the information from the old database, with a few exceptions:
- Accounts that were marked as disabled or registration-incomplete will be deleted. These won't change state in the old keyshare server
  anymore, and were completely unusable from the perspective of an app or myirma anyway.
- As for the email tokens, only registration email address verification tokens are going to be converted. A redirect page for the url used
  with these tokens will need to be set up together with the new server to keep them usable. Login email tokens are not transferred, as these
  are intended for short-term use anyway, making them not worth the complexity.

Furthermore, we require from the original keyshare server database that usernames are all unique. As this is not guaranteed, this needs to
be checked prior to migration.
